# Configuration Language

The Open Services Cloud Configuration Language allows you to describe your service and interaction with fundamentals services (computing, network, billing, ...).


The first part of OCL describes the metadata of the basic configuration of the service, the metadata of the resources required by the service
## resources
`resources` used to describe the infrastructure of the service and the metadata of the resources required by the service
(storage, computing, network, mirroring, etc.),`resources` is a list of `OclResource`,  each `OclResource` contains attributes such as `category`,`name`,`properties` etc.

* `category` - (Required) It is the cloud resource type provided by the cloud vendor.
* `name` - (Required) The name of the Cloud Resource
           Possible values include: `vpc`、`subnet`、`security`、`storage`、`vm`、`baseImage`、`provisioner`、`billing` (more type will be coming).
* `properties` - (Required) Preset detailed attributes of various cloud resources and their dependent cloud resources, 
                  The dependency relationship of each resource is defined in the properties of the relying party's cloud resource, that is, the `type` property value of the dependent party's cloud resource is used as the key, and the `name` attribute value of the dependent party's cloud resource is used as the value to define in the relying party's cloud resource. In the properties of the resource

```YAML
resources:
  - category: vpc
    name: vpc1
    properties:
      cidr: 192.168.0.0/16
  - category: subnet
    name: subnet-web
    properties:
        cidr: 192.168.10.0/24
        gatewayIp: 192.168.10.1
        vpc: vpc1 # subnet depends on vpc
        dnsList:  
          - 100.125.1.250
          - 100.125.129.250

## Terraform Provider

OCL is also available as Terraform Provider, supporting the same details as above.

```hcl

    currency      = "euro"
    fixedPrice    = 20
    variablePrice = 10
    variableItem  = "instance"
  }
